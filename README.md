The structure of the repository should be:

### Analysis

- The mice treated with Capomulin had lower tumor volumes on average
- The mice treated with Capomulin lived longer in total (i.e. the largest count of total timesteps in the dataset)
- There is a strong positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient(r) =0.84) for mouse weight and average observed tumor volume mice with the Capomulin regimen
